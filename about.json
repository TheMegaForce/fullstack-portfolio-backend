    "bio": "I am a Software Engineer who has a passion for puzzle-solving and developing projects that satisfy, if not go beyond the users’/clients’ expectations. As someone with a background in art such as sketching, I like to focus on the smaller details in the front-end development to make the project look and work as smoothly and as satisfyingly as possible."
